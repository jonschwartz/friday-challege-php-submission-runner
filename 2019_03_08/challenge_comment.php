/**
* Is Kevin Elephpant's birthday!  The other elephpants want to write Happy Birthday to him,
* but all their letters got jumbled.  This week's challenge is to re-arrange the letters to
* give Kevin a happy birthday!
*
* Caveats:
*  - Can you do it with only array_* functions?
*  - there may be some extra letters in the elephpant's pile of letters
*  - you should actually try to re-arrange the message from the pile of letters, not just return an array in the correct order
*
* Good Luck!
