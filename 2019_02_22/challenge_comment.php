/**
* The elephpants want in on that sweet sweet toddler Youtube money.
* They've realized that if they take the biggest songs that toddlers
* like these days and just insert elephpant instead of, for instance,
* shark, they could make billions!  The problem is, they don't really
* want to do a lot of work to get this done.  So, this week's challenge
* is to write a song "Baby Elephpant" to the tune of "Baby Shark" using
* as little code as possible which is just Baby Shark with the word
* Shark substituted out for Elephpant.  Your function will receive
* no input and must output the entire song.
*
* That's right, devs!  It's Code Golf!
*
* Good Luck!
