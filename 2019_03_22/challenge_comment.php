/**
* The elephpants want some quick answers on home maintenance.
* They know there's a bunch of data that goes behind the questions
* to get them their answers, but they don't want to have to deal
* with which questions have to get answered internally.
* They just want to pass their question and their data to our
* code and get one answer. Done.
*
* Caveats:
*  - Not all the data is relevant to get the answers
*  - some internal questions that should be answered
*      1) Do we have any paint of the right color / can we make it with colors we have?
*      2) Do we have all the tools we need?
*      3) Are we allowed to paint the house we live in?
*      4) Do we know how to paint?
*  - try looking at the facade design pattern https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/facade-design-pattern-introduction/
*
* Good Luck!
