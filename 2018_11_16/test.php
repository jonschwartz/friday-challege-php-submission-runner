/**
 * This week goes to @grwalker but only just barely!  @rparekh submitted the exact same code.
 * Greg gets it for speed to entry.  Both solutions used just 3 library functions and 3 user
 * submitted lines of code (excluding whitespace)  to accomplish the task.
 * Well done everyone!  Sticker Clause (see #friday-challenge for context) left some
 * stickers on my desk Cop02-T2-E3 (the seat with the elephpants) and anyone who participated
 * in the challenge is free to grab one.  @grwalker gets the trophy (I got it to re-printâ€¦)
 * this week!  Hope to see you all next challenge!
