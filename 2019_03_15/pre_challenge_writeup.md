@here Ok Devs, it's time for this week's challenge!  

This week we're exploring the factory pattern. 
 
I've set up some classes for you, but you don't need to use them.  
The only requirement is that the signature of the final milk shake 
matches the signature in the test.  If you chose to use the interface
that I made, great!  If not, also great!

Good Luck!
