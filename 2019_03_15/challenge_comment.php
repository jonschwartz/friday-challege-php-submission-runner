/**
* The elephpants are buying a factory.  This factory is going to whip up different kinds of milk shakes.
*
* The milk shakes can have different flavors and sizes.
*
* The challenge this week is to implement the milk shake factory.
*
* Possible flavors include:
*  Chocolate, Vanilla, Strawberry, Coffee
*
* Sizes Include:
*  Small, Medium, Large, Child Sized (because it's the size of a 2 y/o child.
*                                    Don't include these parens in your size
*                                    description.  This is a Parks and Rec joke.
*                                    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ish8NBunrQU )
*
* Caveats:
*  - Try using the factory pattern for this one.
*
*  - I've set up some classes below but you don't need to use them as long as
*    your final shake object conforms to the signature (not necessarily the interface)
*    I'm looking for.
*
* Good Luck!
