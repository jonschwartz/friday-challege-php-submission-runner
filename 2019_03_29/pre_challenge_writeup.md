@here Ok Devs, it's time for this week's challenge!  We're looking into a classic graph problem, the traveling salesman (err... elephpant).

See https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/travelling-salesman-problem-set-1/ for context and/or help

There's a chance my path is not optimal in the test.  If one of you can find a more optimal path, please tell me and I'll adjust the test accordingly.

Here's a picture of the graph if that helps you: https://wayfair.slack.com/archives/DBZ2U2TFY/p1553799181000100
