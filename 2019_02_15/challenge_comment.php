/**
* One of the elephpants' favorite games is reporter.  They observe something in the world.
* They write about it.  Then they publish their writing on the side of their desks.
* Other elephpants come by and, if they're interested, they read the report.
* If they're not, they keep walking until they see a report they like pop up.
*
* While this is all well and good, the elephpants do a heck of a lot of walking
* while waiting for a report to come that they want to read.  It'd be much better if
* something delivered all the reports they were interested in straight to their desks.
*
* This week's challenge is to implement a report retriever who can search through
* all the reports that come through and only grab the ones their designated elephpant has asked
* for.
*
* Caveats:
*  - reports will only have 1 topic
*  - elephpants will only have 1 favorite topic they want to know about
*
* Good Luck!
