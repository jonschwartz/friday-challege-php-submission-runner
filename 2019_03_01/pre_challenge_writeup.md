@here Ok Devs, it's time for this week's challenge!  

This week, we're designing online ordering software for a pizza shop!  I've been thinking about
doing a series of these challenges where we explore different design patterns.  This week, a 
good way of implementing a solution here could be the decorator pattern.  Or you can just do
some joins() and sums and call it a day (easier to implement but harder to extend).  I'm going
to judge higher for re-usable solutions this week.  

Good luck!!
