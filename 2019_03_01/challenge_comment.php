/**
* The Elephpants are opening a pizza shop.  They need some code to run their online ordering system.
* They want this code to be very extensible as they change their menu since they know what type of
* pizzas they want to sell at the beginning, but that may change as they gather data on what
* their customers like to eat.  The challenge this week will have you take in an array of menu items
* and you should output a description of the final pizza and the total cost for those items.
*
* Caveats:
*  - take a look at the decorator pattern (possibly)
*  - make sure your solution can add new items easily
*  - any of the descriptions in the test are valid.  There are probably others and if you're close, I'll give it to you.
*
* Good Luck!
